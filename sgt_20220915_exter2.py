# 2. Almost Hangman
# Write a program to recognize a text symbol
# The user (first player) enters the text.
# Only asterisks instead of letters are output.
# Assume that there are no numbers, but there may be spaces.
# The user (i.e. the other player) enters the symbol.
# If the letter is found, then the letter is displayed in ALL the appropriate places,
# all other letters remain asterisks.
# Example:
# First input: KartupeÄ¼u lauks -> ********* *****
# Second input: a -> *a****** *a***
# In principle, this is a good start to the game of hangman.
