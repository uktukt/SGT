# 1a. Average value

# Write a program that prompts the user to enter numbers (float).

# The program shows the average value of all entered numbers after each entry.
# PS. 1a can do without a list

# 1b. The program shows both the average value of the numbers and ALL the numbers entered

# PS Exit the program  by entering "q"

# 1c The pro

#     user_input = input(
#         "Please enter numbers(separated by comma) or 'q' to quit: ")
#     if user_input == "q":

#         break

#     else:
#         list_numbers.append(float(user_input))
#         sorted_number_list = sorted(list_numbers) 
#         # if we did not need original order
#         # then we could have used list_numbers.sort() instead
#         average_calculated = sum(list_numbers) / len(list_numbers)
#         print(
#             f"Numbers you entered are: {list_numbers} , average is: {average_calculated}")

#         print(f"Bottom 3 values you entered are: {sorted_number_list[:3]}")
