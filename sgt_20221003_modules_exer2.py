# 2. Deck - probably for homework, see how far you get

# write a class Deck with the following attributes(variables)
# available - contains list of card tuples that can be used
# spent - contains list of card tuples that have been used
# there should be following methods:

# constructor (__init__) method
# initializes available with full 52 card list of tuples
# initializes spent with empty list
# shuffle(self):
# # shuffles available cards - works just like 1st function but works on available

# get_cards(self, count=1):
# # gets some number(default 1) of cards from available 
# adds these cards to spent
# returns these cards

# # you can add other methods and/or attributes if you wish to Deck class
